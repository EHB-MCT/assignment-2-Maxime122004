# Unity Race Game Project
## Project Overview
This Unity project implements a first-person movement system with jump mechanics and integrates Unity Analytics for tracking player events, such as jump counts. It also includes interactive features like a finish line that displays UI feedback when triggered.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Unity (version 2022.1 or later).
2. Open the `Scenes/Main.unity` scene.
3. Press "Play" to start the game.

## Features
- **First-Person Controller**: Smooth movement and mouse-controlled camera.
- **Jump Mechanics**: Tracks jump counts and records data to Unity Analytics.
- **Finish Interaction**: A finish pole triggers a UI message when touched.
- **Unity Analytics Integration**: Tracks and sends custom events to the Unity Analytics dashboard.

## Key Scripts
- `FirstPersonMovement`: Manages player movement, camera control, jumping, and finish line interactions.
- `AnalyticsScript`: Implements Unity Analytics functionality to track custom player events, such as jump counts.

## How Unity Analytics Is Used
Unity Analytics is used to record and monitor custom events. The playerâ€™s jump count is tracked and sent to the analytics dashboard with the event name "jump" and a `jump_index` parameter indicating the current jump count.

### Viewing Analytics Data
1. Log in to the [Unity Dashboard](https://cloud.unity.com/home/organizations/1374483532186/projects/f280becc-6a37-4842-b207-9507da68ee32/environments/b37097e3-0e87-4859-b56e-391c917411c5/analytics/v2/dashboards/game-performance).
2. Navigate to Analytics > Events.
3. Verify that the "jump" event appears along with the jump count data.
